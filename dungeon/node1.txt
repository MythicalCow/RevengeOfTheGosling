It was the second day after you were notified to report to the guild. 
Thousands of adventurers had gone before you. 
Some returned with mere bags of dirt and seeds. Some returned with wood and materials. Most did not return at all.
All of them were united on the quest to reunite the realms.
The realms fragmented when you were just a child, and you were fortunate to remember what the color green even looked like in a natural setting. 
Your parents, however, probably ended up in different NODES, and now their faces were but a distant memory.
The many races and peoples living here were mostly content with their lives, however. 
They lived in houses made of the glowing purple slabs that were hewn out of the floating islands that made up the NODE. 
Many, many people went past the first step, the FOREST, and were either unable to find their way home, or died in their journey. 
But why was THE FOREST special? You didnâ€™t know. 
Apparently, the raw materials restored themselves magically every time another party went.
Years ago, you discovered a rare Stone of the Planewalker while making your own house out of the illusionary slabs. 
It was a glowing, purple thing, and it was only special because it managed to maintain its circular shape in the rigid environment of the NODE.
Gathering up your friends, who had been conscripted recently, you decided to walk towards the registry.
