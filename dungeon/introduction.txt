Introduction

In the beginning, before the splitting of the seas, before the rise of the mountains, and the pit to below opened, there was CODE.

CODE was a primordial force. It could CHANGE the world. It could MAKE new rules within our realms. It could DESTROY realms if necessary.

There was a great WAR. Thousands of CODE wielders were slain, but many BUGS were defeated as well. 

In the end, two mediocre scholars, one an apostle of CODE, and another an apprentice of the great WORDSMITH, stepped up.

They began a great debate against THE GREAT SERPENT, ORIGINATOR OF BUGS.

In the end, THE GREAT SERPENT, or PYTHON, conceded to the debate, and retreated into THE SCAPES.

The SCAPES were a separate world with nine layers built within its void, where THE GREAT SERPENT could rule.

And the control of this world was relinquished to the CODER and the WORDSMITH, who abolished the split realms….

And unified this world into ONE.

However, being novices at their craft, the great creators left behind seven BUGS.

The BUGS endured through the great development process.

Years later, after the creators retreated from this world, the BUGS re-emerged.

They split the world into eight realms. 

And as the different worlds were torn apart once more…

The BUGS possessed powerful members of the locals.

Then, they cut their own realms off from the eighth, the only one left in our control.

Years later, through the GREAT FILE SEARCH, these rogue realms would be located.

Heroes would be selected in order to bring the realms back together, and subdue the BUGS.

This is their story…
